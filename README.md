# Sem2_Engineering_Design_Project
This repository contains the codes written for the EN1190 Engineering Design Project module in semester 2 by our team SPARTANS.

3rd Party ibraries used in our project are,
  * HX711 library (to be used with the load cell) and
  * Time library (To keep track of time after it is initially set up by the WiFi module)

Here's a close lookup of our final product.
